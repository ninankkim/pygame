### Monster Hunter PyGame - Nina Kim

The project was completed independently using Python. The code utilized a pygame sprite coding template to create a 2D game that involves a total of 5 characters: the hero, monster, and three goblings. The objective is the hero must catch the monster, while bypassing the incoming goblins. The game included designated keys to allow hero movement for user participation. The monster and goblins were coded with randomized movements depending on their location. The pygame was created using the foundational knowledge of Python: conditional statements, dictionaries, classes, and booleans. 

### The Goals

The project was successfully completed and the requirements were meant. The code provides the user with the arrow key functions to move around the map to chase down the monster, and allows for swift movements away from any goblins. The monster and goblin were coded in similar manners, using if/else statements that would then generate a randomized order of movement. Once the user was able to successfully catch the monster, a winning music sound would play and then the user would be shown a "play again" button that would then start the entire game again. If the user was unsuccessful, then a losing music game would play and the "play again" would appear again, allowing the user to play once more.
